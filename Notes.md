Same result. Only works from running "dotnet run" at the command line.

Attempted to install .Net 6 and .Net 5 but these are too new for OS X 10.12
Installed .NET Core 3.1 SDK (v3.1.415) but even running dotnet resulted in an error
Eventually used an uninstaller and backups from TimeMachine to restore the orginal .Net Core 2.1.2 SDK (v2.1.302) files and returned to being able to call dotnet run from the command line.

Spent lots of time considering different IDEs (VS Code, Visual Studio for Mac, Rider) and different hardware and operating systems (Lenovo ThinkCentre M91p with Windows 7 and VS Code, Visual Studio or Rider). Each will require non-trivial amounts of time to implement.

Wrote Lawrence Joshua "LJ", Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Absorb to ask which of these hardware, OS, and IDE combinations would be closest to what is used at Absorb so I can at least practice the best set of keyboard shortcuts.

Still don't have a means to run the code from the IDE with a key or icon press. Don't have a testing frame work. So no TDD yet. I'd rather now develop without at least these. I would also like to use Approval Tests [https://approvaltests.com/]

Will consider using current computer, with current IDE. Will continue in the morning.

Printed Coding Exercise v. 1.1.3.pdf
Noted nouns and verbs as first step to determine object model

Users:
Customers
Marketing team

Nouns:
a prototype checkout system
current price catalog
products, items
regular price, effective price
promotions (limited time)
        On Sale price = a price less than the regular price
    Advanced:
        Group promotional price based on the quantity purchased
        Additional product discount
Quantity of specific product, an attribute of the customer basket or a promotion
Time for promotions and time of checkout
Customer’s basket
final total price
Latest pricing rules
    (current price catalog, promotions)
Itemized receipt
    (item, regular price, discount or saving, [effective price?]) + final total price

Inputs:
current price catalog
promotions
customer’s basket = a simple file containing *unsorted* list of items=products in which a product can be listed multiple times

Verbs:
Checkout
apply promotion
Calculate
Display
Print itemized receipt

Output
Itemized receipt
    (item, regular price, discount or saving, [effective price?]) + total price

Assumptions
prices in dollars though ‘$’ can be replaced with other symbols
dollars - tenths and hundredths, rounded
rounding in GroceryCo’s favour

All time in local time - events would otherwise be recorded in UTC - we make this assumption as the kiosks are in physical stores and the transactions aren’t happening all hours of the day possibly crossing midnight and therefore different dates.
Promotions change at the last minute but are assumed to be in effect only on given dates not during different hours or minutes of a day.
Future challenge: use UTC times for everything so as to make a promotion effective at a moment rather than a date.

each line of the customer’s basket file represents only one item, no instances of
“3 apples”, only
“
apple
apple
apple
”
Won’t use commas in customer basket file

current price catalog and promotions as input text files rather than database engine data

width of receipt on paper fixed

effective price listed on receipt even though it isn’t called for in the instructions

lowest price (regular or effective) is zero. No negative prices.
No sales that increase the prices.

No logging as I am not yet familiar with C#’s logging modules

No consideration for translating amounts into other currencies. e.g. no translating into U.S.A. dollars.

Spelling? Yes,
Case of letters? is rose=Rose?

Now, back to running Hello World.
Yes! I can set a break point, run the code in debug mode, it will stop and I can inspect the state and then step forward in the code!

Don’t forget to lookup variable naming standards for C#.

        Add Product
        
I have products that have regular price.

Next, put a few of products into a dictionary and then save it to json file to see the result.

"If the list is populated all at once from sorted data, SortedList<TKey,TValue> is faster than SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>."
- But the customer basket will not be sorted and the calculation process will need have the data structed holding the results of the customer basket being built each time.

Add more catalogue tests and notes


Deciding if I should have
<string name, Product> 
    pairs in which the name is repeated,
<string, Amount> pairs, or
<string, decimal> pairs

Just use the pair in the dictionary to represent 
what I've been calling a product.

I'll continue with the current experiment for now.

ExampleCatalogueAsDictOfProducts.json:
{
  "Pineapple": {
    "RegularPrice": {
      "Symbol": "$",
      "Amount": 1.08
    },
    "Name": "Pineapple"
  },
  "Pepperoni": {
    "RegularPrice": {
      "Symbol": "$",
      "Amount": 5.73
    },
    "Name": "Pepperoni"
  }
}

I can see that this will work but it is a bit
over done. Having the name as a property and the 
key of each entry is redundant. Having the Symbol
repeated for each entry is redundant.

I'm am considering symplifying things knowing I can
add the product object back in if needed.

         
All that is needed now is:

{
  "Pineapple": 1.08,
  "Pepperoni": 5.73
}
         
But, using the json serializers means I don't have
to do the serialization manually. The output to the
screen or a saved file for users can be different.
Will continue the experiment with a new 
toString() method. The dictionary of the catalogue
would mostly likely be data stored behind a 
database engine.

What is the process of reading in the basket?
It will result in a sorted dictionary of product 
name as the key and the quantity as the value.

The calculation will begin with retrieving the 
regular price for each of the product names in the
sorted dictionary. This will require the name as 
the key and then pulling out the 
product.regularprice.amount and appending that to
 the value in the dictionary
then applay promitions by item and quantity to 
get the effective price for the product

Then the total can be found by totalling the 
effective prices. These results can be achieve by 
a more functional style. Would the process be 
easier if the amount is pulled from a name: amount 
paring in the dicionary. I don't see there being a 
big difference.

Next, make a new diplay method.

Now that I'm attempting to read in the ProductCatalogue from a file, it is clear that a simple <string, decimal value> pair will be much easier to read back into a dictionary.
So, next, simplify the whole ProductCatalogue class.
[How do I read and write a C# string Dictionary to a file?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27025435/how-do-i-read-and-write-a-c-sharp-string-dictionary-to-a-file)

OPTION 3 - Use JSON.NET
File.WriteAllText("SomeFile.Txt", JsonConvert.SerializeObject(dictionary));

Read:

var dictionary = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string, string>>
    (File.ReadAllText("SomeFile.txt"));
    
    
Or with JSON.Net you can serialize your dictionary to JSON and then write it to file and then deserialize it, like:
    ```
    Dictionary<string, string> dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    dictionary.Add("1", "Some value 1");
    dictionary.Add("2", "Something");
    ```
Storing Dictionary in file:
    ```
    string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(dictionary);
    File.WriteAllText("SomeFile.Txt", json);
    ```
Getting Dictionary back from file:
    ```
    Dictionary<string, string> previousDictionary =
     JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string, string>>
                                     (File.ReadAllText("SomeFile.txt"));
    ```


I can not write to files from tests but I can write to files from the production code.

I can use
```
JsonConvert.SerializeObject(catalogue, Formatting.Indented);
```
to fomat the file to be eaiser to read.

Now to commit and rebuild the ProductCatalogue class.



Test writing and reading catalogue to file


Now that I'm attempting to read in the ProductCatalogue from a file, it is clear that a simple <string, decimal value> pair will be much easier to read back into a dictionary.
So, next, simplify the whole ProductCatalogue class.


ExampleCatalogueAsDictOfProducts.json:
{
  "Pineapple": {
    "RegularPrice": {
      "Symbol": "$",
      "Amount": 1.08
    },
    "Name": "Pineapple"
  },
  "Pepperoni": {
    "RegularPrice": {
      "Symbol": "$",
      "Amount": 5.73
    },
    "Name": "Pepperoni"
  }
}

Is harder to work with than:
CatalogueFile.json
{
  "Pineapple": 3.99,
  "Pepperoni": 5.73,
  "Apple": 1.08,
  "Orange": 1.68,
  "Banana": 0.79,
  "Milk": 2.85,
  "Salmon": 20.64,
  "Cheese": 7.42,
  "Bread": 3.54,
  "Olive oil": 12.58,
  "Chocolate bar": 2.15,
  "Fennel seeds": 3.45,
  "Pepper": 4.05,
  "Cantaloupe": 3.79,
  "Eggs": 8.14,
  "Celery": 2.75,
  "Lettus": 6.0,
  "Nutmeg": 4.93
}


Redo MoneyAmount and Product tests

Having the ProductCatalogue retrieve the data from the file is proving untestable and probably a bad design.
Tomorrow I will try separating the file read and writing parts of the ProductCatalogue so that the other operations can be tested.



Add CustomerBasket 

using ProductCatalogue as a template
neither should refer to reading the file in the constructor

Spent too much time setting up a dev environment and too much time focusing on files instead of the core problem, implementing promotions.
Next, implement Calculate and Promotions

Spending too much time on Classes and Builders

Continuing to develop solution using TDD.


Add RetrievePricesForBasket()

and ProductReceiptDetails as list items for a simple receipt.
Added a stub for Promotions as an empty string.
Next, total price

- Used a dictionary for the Product Catalogue as it can be queried at O(1). I'd expect an actual catalogue to be very large.
- Used a sorted dictionary for sorting the basket as I do not expect the basket to be so large that O(n*log()n)) is too much of a cost and it provides the sorting.
- Used a list for the ProductReceiptEntries as the baskets has been sorted.

Remove unnecessary usings

uncommented and fixed tests
for ProductCatalogueTests

Added more Promotions tests.

Next, begin to implement promotions.

Add Promotions and updated CalculateTests

- The promotions are shown in json format. They are not read from a file but stored in a GenerateSeedPromotions() method.
- There remain lots of opportunities to refactor.

- The receipt output has many hardcoded field widths and many of the tests are
dependent on the receipt so many of the tests are fragile. A proper separation
of the contents and the output widths would be much better. Also not using hard
coded numbers in the LefPad() and RightPad() methods.
